                    <img src="/img/section/new-zealand-section.jpg" alt="new-zealand-view"/>
                    <p>New Zealand (or Aotearoa – land of the long white cloud), truly is one of the most picturesque and photogenic places on earth. A small island nation of just over 4.5 million people, New Zealand is made up of two major land masses (North Islandand South Island) and a number of smaller islands including Stewart Islandlocated in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The two main islands are divided by a 22km stretch of water called the Cook Strait.New Zealand is located approximately 1,500km east of Australia and about 1,000km from the Pacific Islands. Due to its relative remoteness and being water locked, New Zealand was one of the last countries...</p>

                    <h3>Alberta, Canada</h3>
                    <img src="/img/section/alberta-section.jpg" alt="alberta-view"/>
                    <p>Occupying the northern half of the North American continent, the province of Alberta is located between 60 degrees and 49 degrees latitude north along the Canada-U.S. border. Spanning 661,185 square kilometres (255,200 square miles), Alberta covers almost 7% of Canada’s land mass. The diverse landscape includes mountains, glaciers, foothills, lakes, rivers, forests, badlands, wetlands and open plains. Approximately 90 per cent of Alberta is part of North America's interior plain, with heavily forested areas and peat lands in the north, grasslands in the south and parkland in the east and central areas.</p>

                    <p>British Columbia is Canada's most westerly province, and is a mountainous area whose population is mainly clustered in its southwestern corner. BC is Canada’s third-largest province after Québec and Ontario, making up 10 per cent of Canada’s land surface. British Columbia is a land of diversity and contrast within small areas. Coastal landscapes, characterized by high, snow-covered mountains rising above narrow fjords and inlets, contrast with the broad forested upland of the central interior and the plains of the northeast.</p>

                    <h3>Alaska, USA</h3>
                    <img src="/img/section/alaska-section.jpg" alt="alaska-view"/>
                    <p>Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States and has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the Aleutian Islands extend into the Eastern Hemisphere. Alaska is the only non-contiguous U.S. state on continental North America; about 500 miles (800 km) of British Columbia (Canada) separates Alaska from Washington. It is technically part of the continental U.S., but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called "the Lower 48". The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.</p>

                    <h3>Iceland</h3>
                    <img src="/img/section/iceland-section.jpg" alt="iceland-view"/>
                    <p>celand is a volcanic island located in the North Atlantic Ocean, 300 km east of Greenland and 900 km west of Norway. The main island, which lies south of the Arctic Circle, covers an area of 103,000 km, which is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Virginia or slightly bigger than Ireland. Over 10 percent of Iceland’s territory is covered by glaciers, which includes Vatnajökull, the largest glacier in Europe. Due to its volcanic origin, the country’s nature features gushing geysers, natural hot springs, as well as lava fields spreading as far as the eye can see. The volcanic activity of Iceland made international headlines in recent years with the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in 2010 and the Grimsvötn eruption in 2011.</p>
